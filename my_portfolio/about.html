                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p>My journey has been defined by curiosity, discipline, and a desire to grow across different fields. I’ve always been someone who questions how things work—from technology and programming to art, music, and communication. This mindset naturally led me toward continuous learning.

     I began exploring software development on my own, gradually building a foundation in Java, databases, Git, API tools, and project workflows. Over time, I strengthened my understanding of core programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and real-world development practices such as version control, testing, and teamwork. This hands-on learning process helped me transition from basic experiments to structured projects that reflect both creativity and logic.

     Furthermore, I’m also deeply curious about music and its creative processes. I play guitar and compose music. I have a few song projects that are released. Beside musicianship, I am the co-founder of rock music related blog page - Metalbash which enhanced my teamwork and multitasking abilities.

     Beyond technical skills, I’ve also developed experience in communication, content creation, and teamwork through volunteer roles, university projects, and community involvement. These experiences taught me responsibility, adaptability, and the value of contributing to a team—skills that continue to influence how I approach challenges today.

     Overall, my journey is an ongoing process of learning, building, and improving. I embrace both the technical and creative sides of my personality, and I am always looking for new opportunities to expand what I know and apply it in meaningful ways.</p>
