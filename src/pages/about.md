        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
    My academic and personal journey began at School No. 318, where I
    completed my school education and developed an early interest in both
    technology and creative fields. In 2024, I took an important step forward
    by starting my higher education at ADA University.
  </p>

  <p>
    My first year at university was a Foundation Year, during which the studies
    were entirely focused on English language education. This year played a key
    role in strengthening my academic communication skills and preparing me for
    university-level coursework. From the following academic year, I began
    studying University Core and Major Core courses.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning of the new year, together with two friends, I co-founded
    a rock and metal music news blog called Metalbash. The platform focuses on
    developing the rock community in Azerbaijan while sharing news about both
    local and global rock and metal music. We actively communicate and
    collaborate with Azerbaijani rock and metal bands.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main role in Metalbash is creating post designs and managing visual
    content for our official Instagram, Telegram, and TikTok accounts. I
    regularly communicate with other administrators and take part in decisions
    related to content planning, partnerships, and new ideas. This experience
    has significantly improved my teamwork, communication, and multitasking
    skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Music is an important part of my life alongside my academic activities.
    I play electric guitar, sing, and compose songs. I have several tracks that
    are publicly released, while some ongoing compositions are currently in
    progress. These newer works are more professionally structured and include
    elements of classical music. I am also a member of the university music
    club, where students perform songs and sing together as a choir.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to music and studies, I am actively involved in volunteering.
    I have been a volunteer with the university-based organization ADA Watchmen
    for seven months. The Watchmen work closely with campus security to ensure
    safety and order during events. As a PR Manager, I am responsible for
    taking photos and creating social media content during the events we attend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, I volunteered at the ICPC programming competition in August and
    September, where I was part of the crowd control team. My responsibilities
    included guiding participants and guests and helping maintain a safe and
    organized environment throughout the competition.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2025, I also volunteered at the Formula 1 Grand Prix as an access control
    member at Crystal Hall, which served as the concert venue. This role
    required endurance and responsibility, as I worked for long hours in
    challenging weather conditions without breaks while ensuring proper access
    control and attendee safety.
  </p>
  Overall, my journey reflects a balance between academics, creativity, teamwork, and responsibility, allowing me to continuously develop both professionally and personally.
